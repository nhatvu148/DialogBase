# A repository to learn System and GUI Programming in C++.

# Note on ANSI vs UNICODE:

- If you are compiling in ANSI (MBCS), use \_T(""). This will allow you to transition to UNICODE with the minimum amount of trouble.
- If you are compiling in UNICODE (and never need to compile in ANSI), use L"".
